# natset

Basic functions for a set of natural numbers in C. 
Natural numbers are represented as simple bits in an array. The n^th bit represents number n: if it is 1, the number is in the set, if it is 0, it is not. The main data structure for the set is an array of bytes, so each array element represents 8 natural numbers.
